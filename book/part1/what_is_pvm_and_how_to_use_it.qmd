# What is price volume analysis?

Price-volume-mix analysis (also known as: "variance analysis", "sales/margin bridges", and a bunch of other names) is a financial analysis technique used to quantify factors contributing to a company's financial performance (revenue, profitability, and beyond). While it's a staple in management accounting, finance, and consulting, this technique is less known among data analysts (and data scientists) - it's not something taught in a usual data science/analytics degree, nor it's something covered in that mandatory "Accounting 101" class. 

That's a shame, as few other tools help tell a succinct story about KPIs of interest that are affected by rate vs. quantity dynamics, as well as the PVM technique can. It is an excellent tool to answer questions such as:

* How much of last year's revenue decline is attributable to FX rate differences? 
* How much is the labor cost increase due to salaries vs. additional headcount?
* How much of the average price decline is due to changing product composition? And how much was due to the change in the sales channel mix?
* How much of last year's gross margin increase can be attributed to production yield improvements in a manufacturing business?
* How much did individual regions contribute to a 10ppt overall SaaS business retention rate decline?


# What is Price Volume Mix analysis?

If you ask a data analyst or data scientist about price-volume-mix analysis (also known as: "variance analysis", "sales/margin bridges" and a bunch of other names), you'll likely get a blank stare. It's not something that's taught in analytics curriculum, despite being a standard approach to analyze trends in data in finance and accounting teams (and likely shows up in MBA curriculums). I think that's kind of a shame - analytics teams often encounter situations where they need to "explain a change" in a metric that's simultaneously affected by number of components, and PVM analysis is a great tool for that. It's also behind fancy waterfall charts you may see in consulting reports like this one:

It's a Swiss-army-knife analytical tool to answer questions such as:
* (A multi-national FMCG) How much is price pressure comtributing to the profitability decline vs. budget?
* (Any labor intensive business) How much of the labour cost increase in 2023 is due to salaries vs. additional headcount?
* (A retailer) How much of the average price decline is due to changing product composition?
* (Manufacturing) How much of the gross margin increase last year can be attributed to production yield improvements?
* (A B2C SaaS) What were the key drivers behind retention rate decline in Q3?

In other words, it's all about isolating price (or cost) vs. volume impact on a metric that depends on both of them. While mostly employed in industries where pricing, unit costs and product selection is key (retail, manufacturing), there are use cases in any business that reaches a certain level of complexity and where there are competing "rate" vs. "quantity" dynamics. In a telecom operator (or any subscription business) that's users vs. their average spend, in a consulting business that's # of hours billed vs. hourly rate (vs. labor cost), in any global company it's earnings in their local currency vs. average FX rate ("constant currency" analysis is just a version of PVM). 

In other words, it's super useful. However, glance at resources on the web and you will likely see different formulas, get confused by what exactly "Mix effect" is and struggle to get beyond the basics. I spent 10+ years working in EY's Transaction Advisory (a.k.a. "Strategy and Transactions" today) analysing financial performance of companies and PVM was a frequent tool of choice. But even within EY, we had varying methodologies, terminologies, and other -logies; I happen to be the person who led a development of an internal "handbook for PVM analysis" that tried to provide some common ground for unifying approaches used across the firm, so I dare say I know a few things about the topic. I figured that it may be worth to write (a few) blog posts about it. Besides, I have been scarred by doing PVM analysis in monster Excel workbooks, nasty Alteryx workflows (and even nastier PowerBI implementations), and I wanted to see if I could write up a small Python package as I go along.
