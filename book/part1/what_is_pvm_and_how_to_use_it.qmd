# What is price volume analysis?

Price-volume-mix analysis (also known as: "variance analysis", "sales/margin bridges", and a bunch of other names) is a financial analysis technique used to quantify factors contributing to a company's financial performance (revenue, profitability, and beyond). While it's a staple in management accounting, finance, and consulting, this technique is less known among data analysts (and data scientists) - it's not something taught in a usual data science/analytics degree, nor it's something covered in that mandatory "Accounting 101" class. 

That's a shame - analytics teams often encounter situations where they need to "explain a change" in a metric simultaneously affected by several components. PVM analysis is an excellent tool for that. It's also behind fancy waterfall charts you may see in consulting reports like this one:

An analyst could use the PVM framework to answer any of the following questions:

* __In a product-centric business__: How much did the price pressure contribute to the decline in profitability vs. budget? How much of the overall profitability decline is attributable to pricing pressure in specific markets/product lines? How much of the average price decline is due to changing product composition?
* __In a manufacturing-heavy business__: How much of last year's gross margin increase is attributable to production yield improvements? What was the impact of higher labor costs, and have productivity improvements offset salary increases?
* __In a B2C subscription-driven business:__ How much did each market contribute to the overall increase in retention? How much of the annual recurring revenue (ARR) increase was due to pricing changes vs. existing customer portfolio expansion (upsell) vs. new customer acquisition? What was the impact of the fluctuation in FX rates?

In other words, it's all about isolating price (or cost) vs. volume impact on a metric that depends on both. In industries where pricing, unit costs, and product selection are key (retail, manufacturing), PVM usage is most popular. However, it has use cases in any business that reaches a certain level of complexity and where there are competing "rate" vs. "quantity" dynamics: 

* In a telecom operator (or any subscription business), that's users vs. their average spend; 
* In a consulting shop, that's # of hours billed vs. hourly rate (vs. labor cost); 
* In any global company, that's earnings in the local currency vs. average FX rate ("constant currency" analysis is just a version of PVM). 

With PVM, it's easy to slice & dice the numbers, uncovering over/underperforming business segments while ensuring that you still know their importance in the grand scheme. I am not a fan of "root cause analysis" as a phrase in a business analytics setting (root causes are, typically, bad decisions and not what you find in data), but price-volume-mix analysis is one of the best tools to diagnose issues in company revenue / gross profit performance in a way that leads to actionable insights.

Variance Analysis: The 'Step-Through' Method by F.M. Kirkby (1970)
:::



Price-volume-mix analysis has been around at least since the 1960s - according to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=10&q=related:wW7GAm0M8tYJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,7&scioq=price+volume+mix), there were multiple papers published covering the topic in that decade that touched on the subject. That was the early days of management accounting when scholars developed the concepts of management control and variance analysis and proposed various forms of PVM-like frameworks [see @scapens1984management for a discussion]. These were the days of a manufacturing-centric industry, and such variance analysis discussions often focused on questions not only of the "explain why margins were lower than budgeted" nature but also on selecting optimal product mix and most appropriate costing approaches. 

These discussions led to the eventual rise of operations research (OR) and linear programming applications (optimizing production mix) and gave basis to various costing approaches - full-absorption, activity-based costing, etc. In other words, PVM is as old as management accounting is!
